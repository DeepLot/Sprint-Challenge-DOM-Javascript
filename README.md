## Questions


### 1. What is the DOM?


The DOM (Document Object Model) is an application programming interface that is native to nearly most (I think all) web browsers allowing for the creation of an object structure representation of an html/xml document that can then be manipulated by JavaScript and Java, allowing for more dynamic and powerful websites and web applications.


### 2. What is an event?


An event is when a specific action is performed/condition is met inside of an element within the document being rendered by the Document Object Model


### 3. What is an event listener?


An event listener is a native function that essentially loops over continuously looking for a specific event. Once that event is detected it will execute the callback function fed to the event listener.


### 4. What is a Constructor?


A constructor is a method of a class function that essentially creates or initializes an object of the type specificed. 


## Challenge
Your Challenge is to make a simple `Button` component that hides when it's clicked. There will be three instances in the html. Make sure to give it a little styling of your own.

## Stretch Challenge
Your stretch challenge is to write the functionality of a `Caoursel` component. You have the HTML and CSS already in place. This is an advanced challenge, so you are not expected to be able to complete it. If you begin and don't finish, you should still submit with what you have. You may reference the `Tabs` component for assistance.
